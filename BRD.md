# 7. Timeline, Budget & Resources

## Development Timeline

### Phase 0: Data Collection (Weeks 1-2)

- Subscribe to Spotrac Premium (\$40)

- Export and clean contract data (500-800 contracts)

- Collect player performance stats (MLB Stats API)

- Data validation and quality checks

- **Effort:** 30-40 hours

### Phase 1: Core MVP (Weeks 3-8)

- ML model development and validation

- Backend API (FastAPI + PostgreSQL)

- Frontend development (Next.js + Tailwind)

- Deploy to production (Railway + Vercel)

- **Effort:** 75-105 hours

### Phase 2: Refinement (Weeks 9-12)

- Community outreach (Reddit, baseball forums)

- Analytics setup and monitoring

- Rapid iteration based on user feedback

- **Effort:** 45-60 hours

**Total MVP Timeline:** 16 weeks (4 months), 195-265 hours total

## Budget Breakdown

### MVP Budget (Year 1)

- Spotrac Premium: \$40/year

- Domain (.com): \$12/year

- Hosting (Railway + Vercel): \$0 (free tier)

- Development Tools: \$0 (open source)

- **Total:** \$52

### Scale Budget (Year 1, \> 1K users)

- Hosting (Railway): \$20-50/month (\$240-600/year)

- Analytics (Plausible): \$9/month (\$108/year, optional)

- Spotrac + Domain: \$52/year

- **Total:** \$400-760/year

## Resource Requirements

### Human Resources

- **MVP (Solo Developer):** Full stack dev with ML experience, 10-15
  hours/week

- **Post-MVP (Months 7-12):** Part-time (5-10 hours/week) for features
  and support

- **Year 2+:** Consider contractor for support or feature development

### Technical Infrastructure

- Frontend: Vercel (free tier → \$20/month Pro)

- Backend + DB: Railway (\$0 → \$20-50/month)

- Monitoring: Sentry free tier → \$26/month Team

- Analytics: Vercel Analytics free or Plausible \$9/month

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks

- **Risk:** Model accuracy \< 70%

- **Mitigation:** Multiple algorithm testing, extensive validation,
  contingency pivot to database tool

- **Risk:** Spotrac data access issues

- **Mitigation:** Backup sources identified, local caching, manual entry
  fallback

- **Risk:** Infrastructure costs exceed budget

- **Mitigation:** Free tier suffices for 1K+ users, revenue funds
  scaling costs, caching reduces load

### Market Risks

- **Risk:** Low user adoption (\< 100 users)

- **Mitigation:** Beta testing validates interest, timing launch with
  offseason, community engagement

- **Risk:** Free-to-premium conversion \< 3%

- **Mitigation:** Strong free tier value, clear premium benefits,
  pricing research, flexible pricing

- **Risk:** Competitor launches similar product

- **Mitigation:** Speed to market (16 weeks), differentiation on
  transparency, community building, position for acquisition
